# upm
Universal Package Manager - package your code on any platform, with any language!

## Description
The upm package manager is to be a package manager independent from the operating system and the programming language of the project (if any!).  
It is yet to be planned (not to speak of the implementation...)

upm will:
 * be **convenient to use** for both the packager and user
 * be **independent** from platform, language and servers
 * be **transparent** to the packager
 * be **liberal** about the structure of a package
 * be **open source**
 * be compatible to and convertible from other systems
