# upm
Universal Package Manager - package your code on any platform, with any language!

## Description
The upm package manager is to be a package manager independent from the operating system and the programming language of the project (if any!).  
It is yet to be planned (not to speak of the implementation...)

upm will be:
 * **easy to use** for both the packager and user
 * **independent** from platform, language and servers
 * **transparent** to the packager
 * **liberal** to the packager (in regard to the package/project structure)
 * **open source**
